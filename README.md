# YOLOv8---Landscape-Detection

The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/landscape-recognition-image-dataset-12k-images/data

Annotations were done using Roboflow: https://universe.roboflow.com/landscape-vrtyz/landscape-4plj0

In this project, I focused on the Coast and Desert categories and used Roboflow to detect objects in the images. The annotated classes include objects commonly found in these environments, such as people, rocks, grass, houses, cacti, sand dunes, and more.
